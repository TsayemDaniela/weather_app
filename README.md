# Weather App [WIP]

This repo houses a work in progress of a weather web application intended to provide users
with information about the weather in a city of their choice, using [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

For now, I decided to go with a single page application, where the users get weather information using their exact location or search their 
preferred cities and get information about them on the same page. In the future there might be
a navigation bar with different tabs dedicated to different sections of the web app, like 
Forecasts, Climate data, etc. 


The data on the home page is center-aligned in a single main column and well-spaced out, 
in order to make it easy for the users to view their data and understand it quickly. 

The weather information is fetched from the following API: https://api.openweathermap.org/

I have modified some other aspects such as the ability to toggle between Â°C and Fahrenheit by a click.

The weather animated icons were inserted using a library: https://maxdow.github.io/skycons/
