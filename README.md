# Weather App [WIP]

This repo houses a work in progress of a weather web application intended to provide users
with information about the weather in a city of their choice, using [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

For now, I decided to go with a single page application, since the users can search their 
preferred cities and get information about them on the same page. In the future there might be
a navigation bar with different tabs dedicated to different sections of the web app, like 
Forecasts, Climate data, etc. 


The data on the home page is center-aligned in a single main column and well-spaced out, 
in order to make it easy for the users to view their data and understand it quickly. 
Icons for each of the different states and metrics will also also provided to make the results
less abstract. 


As this project advances and I begin to work on additional features, I will come back to the UI 
and potentially make some adjustments as required, to enhance the overall functionality and 
performance of the app.
